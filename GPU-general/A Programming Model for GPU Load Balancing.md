## A Programming Model for GPU Load Balancing
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3572848.3577434

## Motivation & Contribution
1. Propose a general GPU fine-grained load-balancing abstraction.
2. The abstraction can by easily integrated into existing cuda algorithms and can be flexible and extentable. 
3. Little performance degrade.
